Admiral Steelheart and his famous pirate vessel, The Bilge Pump, have appeared once more. The Admiral is of course never without his elite band of pirate skirmishers, who fly heavily-modded ships. These special craft have uncharacteristically high engine output and thick armor. None bother very much with flux dissipation or shield systems at all, and rely on ballistic limited-ammo weapons. Tactics usually involve hit-and-run, and with their faster vessels the pirates can often get away before sustaining any serious damage.

You will take on the role of the daring pirate, in an attempt to loot the precious cargo of a passing transport fleet. Don't underestimate the fleet's escort, however.
